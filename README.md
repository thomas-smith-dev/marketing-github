[Github User Breakdown](http://github-user-breakdown.ga/)

* Pitch: An app that when given a github username hits the API and returns a breakdown of that user's activity.
* MVP: App displays username, commit history, most common day of week and hour of day ...

## Results
This app was a lot of fun, and one that we plan to continue to work on in order to improve the quality and userfulness. 

## Technical Details
This app was created using HTML, CSS through the LESS preprocessor, ES6 and the Github API.
