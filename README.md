# Marketing project ~ Lambda School WebPT6

[Github User Breakdown]() \*\* Domain name expired

- Pitch: An app that when given a github username hits the API and returns a breakdown of that user's activity.
- MVP: App displays username, commit history, most common day of week and hour of day ...

## Results

This app was a lot of fun, and one that we plan to continue to work on in order to improve the quality and userfulness.

## Technical Details

This app was created using HTML, CSS through the LESS preprocessor, ES6 and the Github API.

## History

Matt and Zac were team members at Lambda School and were placed on this project for the first build week. As the only two members of the team, and the directive of **make it work**, we did. We later found out we were not expected to use a real API, much less the complicated GitHub API and we did not need to use JavaScript. We followed the goal of **make it work** and have since learned many new technologies are battling the job hunt! If you need one or two go getters, hit those GitHub profiles!
Thank you!
